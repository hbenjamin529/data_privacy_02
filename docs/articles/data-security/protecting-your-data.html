                <p>
                    There are many reasons why you should protect your data. Most of us in our lifetimes will experience
                    at least one instance of hacking into one of our accounts - whether it’s banking information, an
                    email account, or social media profile. In this section we have broken down privacy into two
                    categories - basic and advanced. Basic privacy protocols are things everyone should be doing. More
                    advanced protocols are for those who are interested in being more anonymous than the average user.
                    It’s important to note that the more privacy protocols you enact, the less convenient it might be to
                    use various apps, websites, and devices. The balance between privacy and convenience is something
                    that everyone must decide for themselves.
                </p>

                <h5>Basic Privacy Protocols</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <u>Use a password manager</u>
                        <p>
                            A password manager is a great way to ensure that all of your accounts have strong, unique
                            passwords without you having to memorize each and every one of them. The password manager
                            you use should require a password in order to access it and provide organized security
                            across all of your accounts. Never use the same password twice!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Two-factor authentication</u>
                        <p>
                            Many companies have begun to provide two-factor authentication. What this means is that
                            after you enter your login information, there is a second step you must complete in order to
                            access whichever account you are using at that moment. Generally, this means providing an
                            email address or phone number that the company will send an automated, randomly generated
                            passcode to and you must enter that passcode in order to access your account and verify your
                            identity.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Never answer security questions truthfully</u>
                        <p>
                            This may seem counterintuitive, but the sad truth is that most of your personal information
                            is already readily available on the internet. If your security question is “Where were you
                            born?”, a quick internet search could provide these answers to a hacker quite easily. You
                            can utilize your password manager to store your “fake” security question answers safely.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Use a privacy browser</u>
                        <p>
                            Mozilla Firefox in particular has put forth many security measures in order to protect your
                            data. Their newest browser even claims to protect you from browser fingerprinting. There are
                            other privacy browsers available as well. Most importantly, always clear your browser data
                            after every session!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Set your homepage to <a href="www.duckduckgo.com">www.duckduckgo.com</a></u>
                        <p>
                            Most of us instinctively set our homepage in our preferred browser to Google. While Google
                            is an incredibly useful search engine, they are notorious for collecting astronomical
                            amounts of information about you and their reasons for it as well as what they do with it
                            are kept secret. DuckDuckGo is a great search engine that uses private search, tracker
                            blocking, and site encryption.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Use a VPN</u>
                        <p>
                            VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and it helps to hide your identity, internet service
                            provider (also known as ISP), and encrypts traffic coming to and from your network. Avoid
                            free VPNs as they usually are not as secure as the ones you pay for. NordVPN is a reputable
                            provider of privacy services
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Disable location services and bluetooth on all devices</u>
                        <p>
                            This is not to say that you can never use location services or bluetooth, but you should
                            only allow location services and bluetooth to be active when you are actually using an
                            application that needs it. Having it run in the background unnecessarily is just one more
                            way for corporations or criminals to track where you are and what you’re doing.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Remove unused applications</u>
                        <p>
                            This applies for all devices - computers, tablets, and smartphones. You might not think it’s
                            so bad to have some apps hanging around that you don’t really use, but those apps are often
                            collecting data about you in the background without you knowing it. If you use the app less
                            than once a week, delete it!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Never use biometric passwords</u>
                        <p>
                            Biometrics is using biological information about a user to uniquely identify them. Common
                            biometric identifiers are fingerprints and facial recognition. To secure your data across
                            your devices, don’t use these biometric identifiers because they are data that can be stored
                            and potentially bought and sold. Instead, use a long pin number. Don’t ever use your
                            birthday or other significant dates that would be easy to decipher.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Social media</u>
                        <p>
                            Your social media account should have the strongest privacy settings possible. Social media
                            can be fun and great for networking, but the joy we get from interacting with others on the
                            internet often makes us forget about the dangers of social media.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Advanced Privacy Protocols</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <u>Use iMessage or Signal for texting</u>
                        <p>
                            Standard SMS texting is very insecure, but most people don’t realize that. It’s quite easy
                            for someone who knows what they’re doing to tap into your text conversations. To protect
                            yourself, you can use iMessage if you are an iPhone user or use a service like Signal to
                            encrypt your texts and your phone calls.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Use ProtonMail</u>
                        <p>
                            ProtonMail is an email service that is open source and encrypts all of the information in
                            your emails. Email hacking is extremely common and most email service providers can already
                            automatically detect if an email sent to you is fraudulent and direct it to your spam
                            folder, but email services like Gmail and Yahoo also collect your information for
                            themselves. By using their services, you are allowing them to collect myriad data about who
                            you’re talking to, what you’re talking about, and what accounts you have linked to that
                            email.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Encrypt your hard drive</u>
                        <p>
                            Protecting your hard drive protects all the valuable data you have stored on it. Most of us
                            already know to back up our hard drives in case of failure, but how many of us are
                            protecting it with encryption? Hard drive encryption services like BitLocker for Windows or
                            FileLocker for MacOS are great places to start. Also, it’s important to periodically clean
                            your hard drive’s free space by using a service like CCleaner.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <u>Use Tor Browser</u>
                        <p>
                            The Tor Project describes their mission as: “To advance human rights and freedoms by
                            creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting
                            their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular
                            understanding.”
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Delete all social media</u>
                        <p>
                            This may sound extreme, but if you are extremely concerned about privacy, it would be
                            beneficial to delete all your personal social media accounts. Social media provides a great
                            way to identify and track you and to prevent this from happening altogether, all accounts
                            should be removed.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
