                <p>
                    Edward Snowden is a crucial figure to know in regards to our personal privacy. In 2013, he blew the
                    whistle on the unorthodox and invasive procedures performed by the CIA during his employment with
                    them. These procedures and allowances were highly intrusive to the personal privacy of all
                    Americans. After the September 11th attacks in 2001, Congress was quick to pass The Patriot Act
                    which allowed them to essentially spy on us without much or any evidence at all. It’s safe to say
                    most of us were under the impression that in order for government agencies to access things like our
                    personal phone calls, proper protocol involving judicial approval must be followed. Unfortunately,
                    under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, the government was collecting information on the phone calls
                    of millions of Americans without the need for due process. This section of the Patriot Act was ruled
                    unconstitutional in 2015 thanks to Snowden’s actions, but unrestricted access to our personal
                    information by our own government is still under threat.
                </p>

                    Snowden remains a controversial figure. Some revere him as a hero for bringing to light many of the
                    injustices performed against the American people by their own government, but many see him as a
                    traitor who committed treason by releasing valuable information on the security protocols of our
                    intelligence agencies. What he did was noble and his intentions were good, ultimately his goal was
                    to inform and protect the citizens of his home country, the United States. It would be narrow
                    minded, though, to ignore that much of the information he leaked to various sources, including other
                    foreign governments, are potentially detrimental to the safety of our country. For more information
                    on Edward Snowden, we recommend the PBS Frontline documentary “United States of Secrets” that is
                    available publicly and for free through the PBS website.
